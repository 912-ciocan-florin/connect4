# Connect 4
The game is described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)
## Prologue
This Python implementation is an OOP and a layered architecture approach, in which I spiced some AI strategy for the computer's chooses and PyUnit test cases. The minmax algorithm "transform" the computer into a really hard-to-beat opponent. The PyUnit test cases help a lot in testing automatization so all the possible scenarios are covered.
The pygame module was really useful and easy to use in the GUI implementation, which reproduces the OG gameboard and pieces.

## How to play
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) module
3. Run `main.py` with Python
4. Choose how to play the game on the console
```
